To use the RAT backend server, you have to set up a postgresql Database first
Please follow the instructions at ... to set up your database server

It is highly recommended to install all python packages for the backend in a virtual enviroment:
apt-get install python3-venv
python3 -m venv rat
source rat/bin/activate

Just call the bash script to install all packages
bash install-backend_debian.sh

Now it is necessary to change the config files according to your database server and your server for the application:

config_db.ini = Database enviroment
config_proxy.ini = Credentials if you want to use proxies for the scraping of sources / has to be acitvated in config_sources.ini
config_sources.ini = Configuration for the sources scraper

To confirm that the installation is a succes, please run all tests in the /tests folder

The backend uses the chrome extension I don't care about cookies to suppress the popups about cookies. 
However it is necessary to update the exention sometimes and there is also no guarentee that it is future proof.
The extension can be found at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/i-dont-care-about-cookies/fihnjjcciajhdojfnbdddfaoknhalnja?hl=de
To download the crx file, just use https://crx-downloader.com/
Finally replace the file "I-don-t-care-about-cookies.crx" in the crx folder
