It is highly recommended to set up a backend in a virtual enviroment:apt-get install python3-venv
python3 -m venv rat
source rat/bin/activate

If you work on a Debian server, you can just run the script to install all 
bash install-backend.sh

Now it is necessary to change the config files according to your database server and your server for the application:

config_db.ini = Database enviroment
config_proxy.ini = Credentials if you want to use proxies for the scraping of sources / has to be acitvated in 
config_sources.ini = Configuration for the sources scraper

To confirm that the installation is a succes, please run all tests in the /tests folder

The backend uses the chrome extension I don't care about cookies to suppress the popups about cookies. 
However it is necessary to update the exention sometimes and there is also no guarentee that it is future proof.
The extension can be found at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/i-dont-care-about-cookies/fihnjjcciajhdojfnbdddfaoknhalnja?hl=de
To download the crx file, just use https://crx-downloader.com/
Finally replace the file "I-don-t-care-about-cookies.crx" in the crx folder

source start_rat_server.sh
source stop_rat_server.sh
